This repository provides 2 versions of a tutorial exlaining how to embed Bonita Engine (BPM workflow engine)
in a **Spring Boot** application.  

* The [first example](./loan-request-app-gradle-kotlin) illustrates how to build with the application with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
* The [second example](./loan-request-app-maven-kotlin) illustrates how to build with the application with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

The [full tutorial details](./loan-request-app-gradle-kotlin) are provided in the Gradle example, but everything works
the same in the Maven example. Only the build part is specific.
